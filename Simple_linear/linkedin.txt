ðŸ“ˆ Exploring Linear Regression: From Theory to Practice ðŸ“Š

Linear regression is a crucial statistical method used to model the relationship between variablesIn my latest post, I am breaking down linear regression into simple bits.

Types of Linear Regression:

Simple Linear Regression
Multiple Linear Regression
Polynomial Regression

Methods for Finding the Best-Fitting Line:

Closed Form Solution (OLS)
Gradient Descent

Practical Implementation Using Python:
I guide you through a step-by-step example using the Scikit-learn library to train a linear regression model on a dataset predicting student job packages based on their CGPA.

Accuracy Evaluation:
Discover the r2_score metric for evaluating model accuracy and how minimizing squared errors helps in finding the best-fit line.

Demo of Linear Regression: 
I  also shared a manual implementation of linear regression in Python, giving you a deeper understanding of the underlying calculations.
